# ASTRO 2.0 - Autonomous Delivery Robot
## Prototype 0.1

###This prototype is currently capable of:
* Simple motor control system (no feedback)
* Fully wireless
* DualShock 3 remote control
* Adjustable parameters and OOP code

It is still very rudimentary: it works, but not well.

So far, we have the following dependencies:
* Python 3
* nanpy
* pygame
* DualShock 3 drivers (see setup file)

**NEXT STEP: Get camera working**

**NEXT NEXT STEP: Get feedback control**
