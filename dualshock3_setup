# It's possible that some of these installs are not necessary but I don't have enough knowledge to investigate this. This is the combination that works on my setup.

# Get sixpair from web site
wget http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixpair.c
gcc -o sixpair sixpair.c -lusb

# get QtSixA from web site
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtsixa/ ... src.tar.gz
tar xfvz QtSixA-1.5.1-src.tar.gz

At this point remove or rename the file "shared.h" from /home/pi/QtSixA-1.5.1/sixad

# From GitHub get an updated copy of "shared.h"
https://github.com/falkTX/qtsixa/tree/master/sixad

I did this in Windows cutting and pasting from the RAW file in GitHub into Notepad and converting it to Linux line endings in "PyPe", there's probably a better way but this worked.

Copy downloaded "shared.h" into /home/pi/QtSixA-1.5.1/sixad

# (Thanks to robl at "PiBorg-Home-Forums-Raspberry Pi General Discussions-make failure for QtSixA" for this information).

cd QtSixA-1.5.1/sixad

make

sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/sixad/profiles
sudo checkinstall

# At this point the file /etc/default/sixad needs modifying to prevent a "bad buffer" error when trying to connect with sixad.

sudo nano /etc/default/sixad - change LEGACY=0 to LEGACY=2

Attach controller to Pi with USB mini cable
sudo ./sixpair
disconnect
sudo sixad --start &
